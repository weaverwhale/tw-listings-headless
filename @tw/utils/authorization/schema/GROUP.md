# Group

A group of users.
When a group receives a permission, all the users in the group have that permission.
When a new user is added to the group, it receives all the permissions the group has.
When a user is removed from the group, it loses any permissions that it had only insofar as it was a member of the group, but it does not lose any permissions it may have had in its own right.
